# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
There is a Low and a High severity brute force attack found in GuardDuty on an ec2 instance which are brute forcing the password to gain access.
The actual EC2 instance is being used to perform the brute force attack leading to the High severity instance.
There is also a Low severity attack probing an unprotected port. A port on the EC2 instance is not blocked by a security group, ACL or firewall.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
GuardDuty utilises different data sources to begin monitoring. 1. CloudTrail 2. VPC flow logs (from running EC2 instances) 3. Route53 DNS logs. When this was enabled
it would have used the VPC flow logs as its source of information to analyse detect the attack.
