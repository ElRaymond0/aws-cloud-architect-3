Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
`iam-policy-no-statements-with-full-access` has been introduced in this project due to giving full s3 access on the IAM policy.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
To make this rule compliant we would need to give specific permissions to the IAM policy. For example ListBucket action would only grant access to list all or some objects in the bucket.
